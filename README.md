# Project Title

## Brief Summary

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ellie Solhjou, and I'm on a thrilling journey to become a software engineer! ðŸš€ My love for creative problem-solving took root during my time in project management, where I oversaw construction projects worth over $200 million. Working with amazing IT and software engineering teams on innovative smart building projects sparked my curiosity and passion for coding. In my recent bootcamp adventure, I've dived into languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. But it's not just about the codeâ€” I've also been polishing soft skills like attention to detail, effective communication, and being a fantastic team player. I truly believe these skills are key to thriving in the dynamic world of software engineering. I'm pumped for the exciting journey ahead! ðŸŒŸ
